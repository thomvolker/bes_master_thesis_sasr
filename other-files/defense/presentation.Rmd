# Trust and cooperation are central to everyday life

???

Trust and cooperation are central to everyday life, from social and economic relationships to global issues like, for example, combatting climate change. 
Collective cooperation generally leaves everyone better off.
At the same time, cooperation is individually costly, because individuals can unilaterally benefit from behaving opportunistically.
Yet, when people are embedded in a social context, opportunistic behavior today can be retaliated in future interactions, while pro-social behavior can be rewarded.
In this sense, the future is made today, because how others will treat me in the future, depends on how I act today. 
In my thesis, I investigated how the prospect of future sanctions implemented by third parties affects trust and cooperation, which is also called the network control effect.

# Network control hypotheses

- Hypothesis $H_1$: The trustor's trustfulness increases in the amount of network control opportunities.


- Hypothesis $H_2$: The trustee's trustworthiness increases in the amount of network control opportunities.


- Hypothesis $H_3$: Cooperation increases in the amount of network control opportunities.

<br>

- Conjecture 1: We expect more evidence for a network control effect on trustees' behavior than on trustors' behavior.

???

Based on game-theoretical arguments, we derived three hypotheses, that are all evaluated using the data from multiple studies:
The first and second hypotheses state that trustfulness and trustworthiness increase with network control opportunities. 
However, not all studies allow to distinguish between trustfulness and trustworthiness, so that we also hypothesize that cooperation in general increases in the amount of network control opportunities.
Lastly, overseeing the effects of network control might be easier for the trustee than for the trustor. 
We therefore also conjecture that there is more evidence for a network control effect for trustees than for trustors.

# Data & methods

Data from 8 experimental studies on network embeddedness.

- Characteristics differ between studies (e.g., operationalization of network embeddedness)

**Outcome:** *First round trustfulness/trustworthiness/cooperation*

**IV:** *Treatment condition (network embeddedness versus no network embeddedness)*

**Model:** *Depends on study (multilevel structure, measurement of outcome)*

After analyzing all individual studies â†’ Bayesian updating method to aggregate the results.


???

We test our hypotheses using the data from eight, heterogeneous, experimental studies on network embeddedness, that varied, among other things, the specification of the game or the operationalization of network embeddedness.
In each study, we could compare the outcome, first-round trustfulness, trustworthiness or cooperation over two network embeddedness conditions, using appropriate regression models and adjusting the standard errors for clustering. 
After obtaining the results in the individual studies, we used a Bayesian method to aggregate the support for our hypotheses over studies, as expressed in terms of a Bayes factor against the complement hypothesis. 
The complement hypothesis implies no or a negative network control effect.

# Results

Aggregation of all studies (regardless of trustfulness, trustworthiness or cooperation).

```{css, echo=F}
    /* Table width = 100% max-width */

    .remark-slide table{
        width: 100%;
    }

    /* Change the background color to white for shaded rows (even rows) */

    .remark-slide thead, .remark-slide tr:nth-child(2n) {
        background-color: white;
    }

library(tibble)
tibble(`Outcome` = c("All studies combined"),
           `Bayes factor` = 523376168103) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


???

We first aggregated the results over all studies and all outcomes, which renders overwhelming support for the network control hypothesis. 
That is, the network control hypothesis obtains 500 billion times more support than its complement, which is very convincing evidence. 
However, we were not only interested in the support for the network control hypothesis over all studies combined, but we were particularly interested in support for trustfulness, trustworthiness and cooperation separately.

tibble(`Outcome` = c("All studies combined", 
                     " ", 
                     "Trustfulness"),
       `Bayes factor` = c("523376168103", 
                          " ", 
                          "224")) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = c("l", "r"))
```


???

When looking at trustfulness, the aggregated support is considerably smaller than for all studies and outcomes combined.
Yet, the network control hypothesis is still 224 times more likely than its complement, which also indicates strong support for the network control hypothesis for trustfulness.

  knitr::kable(align = c("l", "r"),
               escape=F)
```


???

The results for trustworthiness are again very convincing. 
The network control hypothesis is more than 2 billion times more plausible than its complement.
Additionally, when comparing the aggregated Bayes factors, it can be seen that the aggregated amount of support is much larger for trustworthiness. 
So, although both are convincingly supported, the support for the network control hypothesis for trustworthiness is much larger in magnitude than the support for the network control hypothesis for trustfulness.

```


???

We find no support for the network control hypothesis for cooperation. 
Yet, it must be noted that we only included two studies that assessed cooperation, rather than trustfulness and trustworthiness, of which one found rather strong support in favor of the network control hypothesis, while the other found rather strong support against the network control hypothesis.

# Discussion

**Support**: *quite convincing*.

- Support for network control hypothesis for trustfulness and trustworthiness.

- No support for the network control hypothesis for cooperation.



But, we only relied on experimental studies, and other operationalizations of network control are possible.

???

Overall, we found convincing support for the network control hypotheses for trustfulness and trustworthiness.
In line with our conjecture, the support was more convincing for trustworthiness.
Yet, we found no support for the network control hypothesis for cooperation specifically.
However, for the latter, we only included two studies with mixed findings, and more data could shine more light on the issue.
Yet, note that trustfulness and trustworthiness are in essence the components that make up cooperation, rendering it plausible that the network control hypothesis would hold here as well.
We focused exclusively on experimental studies, which allow to make causal claims on network control effects, and to separate these effects from learning effects, which tends to be difficult in observational data sets.
Yet, it does pose problems with regard to the representativity of the samples, mostly highly educated university students, and questions the generalizability to real-life settings. 
Additionally, there are other operationalizations imaginable that also capture network control effects. 
Yet, these other operationalizations were often not consistently possible throughout all studies under consideration.
